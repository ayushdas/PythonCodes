Creating a git feature branch and merging the changes with original repository
- git branch [Lists the benaches in the repository]
- git branch <feature_branch> [Creates a new feature branch in the repository]
- git checkout <feature_branch> [Switch to feature branch]
- git add . 
- git commit -m "adding a change from the feature branch"
- git push origin <feature_branch> [Push the feature branch to Bitbucket]

- git branch -d branch_name [-d is a simple delete]
- git branch -D branch_name [-D is force delete]
- git push --delete origin <branch name> [Pushes the delete to the repo]
